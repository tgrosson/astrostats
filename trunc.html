        <h2>Terms:</h2>
        <ul class="terms">
            <li>truncation &mdash; undetected objects do not appear in the data in any form</li>
            <li>censoring &mdash; objects are detected, but within the observation limits of the desired variable</li>
            <li>left-censored &mdash; censored data which has an <u>upper</u> limit, so it is to the left of some value</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>R Functions:</h2>
        <ul class="r">
            <li>survival{survfit(Surv_object)}</li>
            <li>fitdistrplus{fitdistcens(censdata,distr)}</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Survival Analysis</h2>
        <p>The survival function \(S(x)=1-CDF(x)\) is the probability that an object has a value above some level <i>x</i>.</p>

        <p>While this is not used directly very often in astronomy, it can be used to infer information about censored data.</p>
        
        <h2>Censoring</h2>
        <h3>Parametric Estimation</h3>
        <p>If we already know the distribution of a censored dataset, we can sometimes directly find the parameters of the distribution to account for the unknown values. For a Poisson distribution which has only 0-values truncated, we have simply \(\frac{\hat{\lambda}}{1-e^{-\hat{\lambda}}}=\bar{X}\).</p>
        
        <h3>Kaplan-Meier (KM) Nonparametric Estimator</h3>
        <p>The EDF of a sample with censoring can be found by redistributing nondetections into the sample with weights associated with the probability that an object is below a certain level.</p>
        
        <h3>Two Sample Tests</h3>
        <p>This is the same question that we asked before regarding whether two samples come from the same distribution. The simplest test for censored samples is the Gehan test, which is a generalized Wilcoxon test. The Gehan statistic is the sum of all cross-sample comparisons, where each individual comparison value is 1 for a value greater than the other point, -1 for a value less than the other, and 0 for ill-determined relationships.</p>

        <h2>Truncation</h2>
        <p>Truncation is harder to deal with than censoring, for obvious reasons, but a few methods exist. One is the Lynden-Bell-Woodroofe estimator, which is quite similar to the KM estimator, except it is based on a truncation limit instead of censored values.</p>
